# perfect_pizza
A complete mobile pizza ordering application.
To run this application, import into Android Studio.

alternatively, if importing is not working...
  1) Find your Android Studio folder
  2) Unzip this app file
  3) Move the unzipped file into your Android Studio folder
  4) Open/Create a new Android Studio project (Choosing Empty Activity works for me)
  5) Open Project -> Select the project that you imported/moved -> Installing any suggested plugins
